# LangGraph Best Practices

To ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable AI Diagnostic Assistant, adhere to these LangGraph specific best practices.

## 1. Clear Node Responsibilities
- **Single Purpose Nodes:** Each node (`parse_user_query`, `fetch_parallel_data`, `analyzeDatadogErrorsTool`) should have a clear, single responsibility. This enhances readability, testability, and reusability.
- **Functionality Encapsulation:** Encapsulate complex logic within helper functions or separate classes that are then invoked by the LangGraph node.

## 2. State Management
- **Typed `AgentState`:** Strongly type your `AgentState` using TypeScript `interface` or `type` to ensure type safety throughout the workflow.
- **Reducer Functions:** For state updates that involve appending to lists (like `messages` or `diagnosticSteps`), utilize LangGraph's reducer functions (`Annotated[list[Type], operator.add]`) to avoid overwriting state.
- **Immutability of State:** While LangGraph handles merging, encourage nodes to return new state objects rather than directly mutating the incoming state, aligning with functional programming principles for easier debugging.

## 3. Error Handling in Nodes
- **Node-Level Error Handling:** Implement `try-catch` blocks within each node's execution logic to gracefully handle exceptions.
- **State for Errors:** Update the `AgentState` to record errors (e.g., `state.errors.push({ node: 'fetchDatadogLogs', message: error.message })`) for later analysis or user feedback.
- **Conditional Edges for Errors:** Use conditional edges to route the workflow based on error presence (e.g., route to a `handle_error` node or `respond_to_user` with an error message).

## 4. Conditional Edge Logic
- **Clear Conditions:** Define conditional edge logic explicitly and clearly. Avoid overly complex conditions within the graph definition itself; delegate complex logic to helper functions.
- **Default Routes:** Always have a default or fallback route for conditional edges to prevent the workflow from getting stuck.

## 5. Tool Definitions
- **Descriptive Docstrings:** Provide clear and concise docstrings for all custom tools (`analyzeDatadogErrorsTool`, `fetchGenieOffer`). These docstrings are crucial for the LLM to understand when and how to use the tools.
- **Typed Parameters:** Use explicit type annotations for tool parameters.
- **Error Handling in Tools:** Ensure tools have internal error handling mechanisms and return informative error messages or indicate failure conditions.

## 6. Checkpointing and Persistence
- **External Checkpointers:** Utilize an external checkpointer (e.g., `MongoDBSaver` or a custom persistence layer if not using LangGraph's built-in options) for long-term state persistence across sessions.
- **Thread IDs:** Use meaningful `thread_id`s to uniquely identify diagnostic sessions for checkpointing.

## 7. Observability
- **Node Execution Logging:** Log the entry and exit of each node, along with the relevant `AgentState` changes.
- **Tool Invocation Logging:** Log when tools are invoked, their inputs, and their outputs (again, minding sensitive data).
- **Tracing Integration:** Ensure LangGraph execution is integrated with distributed tracing (e.g., Datadog APM) to visualize the flow and latency of each node.

## 8. Iteration and Debugging
- **LangGraph Debugging:** Utilize LangGraph's built-in debugging capabilities or integrate with tools like LangSmith for visualizing graph execution paths.
- **Iterative Development:** Build and test nodes and edges incrementally.
