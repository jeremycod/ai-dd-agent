## ðŸŸ¡ Partially Implemented Features

### 7. **Progressive Tool Selection**
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Infrastructure Ready, Not Integrated
- **Implementation**: `ProgressiveToolSelector`, `getToolSelectionPlan()`
- **What's Done**:
  - Service can analyze historical tool effectiveness
  - Creates tiered tool execution plans (tier1, tier2, tier3)
  - Calculates effectiveness scores from similar cases
- **What's Missing**:
  - Integration with actual workflow execution
  - Workflow nodes don't use the tool selection plans yet
  - Still runs all tools in parallel regardless of predictions
- **ðŸ“– [Detailed Documentation](features/progressive-tool-selection.md)**

### 6. **Advanced Pattern Matching (Vector Search)**
- **Status**: âœ… Complete and Working
- **Implementation**: Vector search logic, OpenAI embedding generation
- **What it does**:
  - Semantic similarity search using 1536-dimensional embeddings
  - Finds related cases even with different phrasing
  - Graceful fallback to exact matching when needed
- **Evidence**: Semantic similarity correctly identifies related queries (67% similarity between "validate offer in QA" and "check offer configuration in staging")

- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Concept Only
- **What's Needed**:
  - Multi-dimensional success metrics beyond user feedback
  - Automatic quality assessment of diagnoses

### 9. **Predictive Diagnostics**
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started
- **What's Needed**:
  - Proactive issue identification before full investigation
  - Symptom-based root cause prediction
  - Early warning system for common problems
  - Confidence-based diagnostic suggestions

### 10. **Enhanced Analysis Tools with Historical Context**

  - Individual analysis tools enhanced with similar case context
  - Tools that reference historical patterns during analysis
  - Context-aware error analysis and recommendations

### 11. **Adaptive Workflow Execution**

- Similar case relevance scores
- Prediction confidence vs. actual outcomes
- Learning velocity (how quickly system improves)

The system has a solid foundation for advanced learning with several key capabilities already working, including semantic vector search for finding similar cases. The main focus should now be on integrating progressive tool selection into the actual workflow execution to optimize resource usage based on historical tool effectiveness data.
