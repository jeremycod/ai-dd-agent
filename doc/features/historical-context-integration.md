# Historical Context in Final Diagnosis

## Overview
Enhances AI-generated diagnoses by including relevant historical cases and patterns, providing users with context about what worked in similar situations.

## Implementation Status
✅ **Complete and Working**

## How It Works

### 1. Context Retrieval
```typescript
// From: src/nodes/memoryNodes.ts
const similarCases = await memoryService.retrieveSimilarCases(state);
const relevantPatterns = await memoryService.getRelevantPatterns(state);
// Retrieved during memory_retrieval workflow node
```

### 2. Context Integration
```typescript
// From: src/nodes/summarizeFindings.ts
let historicalContext = '';
if (similarCases && similarCases.length > 0) {
  historicalContext = `\n\nHistorical Context from Similar Cases:\n`;
  similarCases.slice(0, 3).forEach((similarCase, index) => {
    historicalContext += `\n${index + 1}. Previous Case: "${similarCase.userQuery}"\n`;
    historicalContext += `   - Diagnosis: ${similarCase.finalSummary}\n`;
    historicalContext += `   - Tools Used: ${similarCase.toolsUsed?.join(', ')}\n`;
    historicalContext += `   - Outcome: ${getOutcomeFromReward(similarCase.overallRlReward)}\n`;
  });
}
```

### 3. Enhanced AI Prompt
```typescript
const dataForSummaryPrompt = `
  Analysis Results for ${entityType} IDs:
  - Datadog Errors: ${analysisResults.datadogErrors}
  - Datadog Warnings: ${analysisResults.datadogWarnings}
  - History of recent changes: ${analysisResults.entityHistory}
  ${historicalContext}
  ${patternContext}

  Synthesize this information, highlighting critical issues and proposing actionable advice. 
  Pay special attention to patterns from similar historical cases.
`;
```

## Real-World Example

### Before Historical Context
```markdown
# Offer Validation Summary
**Offer ID**: 984249e3-c8a5-3ee2-8650-28be522ac0c4

## Issues Identified
- Missing countries configuration
- 56 errors reported by Genie service

## Recommended Actions
1. Add country configuration
2. Verify IAP configuration
```

### After Historical Context
```markdown
# Offer Validation Summary
**Offer ID**: 984249e3-c8a5-3ee2-8650-28be522ac0c4

## Issues Identified
- Missing countries configuration
- 56 errors reported by Genie service

Historical Context from Similar Cases:

1. Previous Case: "Can you validate if this offer in QA is properly configured?"
   - Diagnosis: Package configuration mismatch between SKU and offer
   - Tools Used: memoryRetrieval, fetchParallelData, runParallelAnalysisTools
   - Outcome: Neutral (reward: 0)
   - Most Effective Tools: entityHistory, datadogErrors

## Additional Notes
The core issue (missing countries) is different from patterns seen in similar 
historical cases, which typically involved package configuration mismatches. 
This suggests this is a unique configuration oversight rather than a systemic issue.

## Key Benefits

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Context**: Users see what worked in similar situations
- **Confidence**: Historical success/failure rates provide confidence indicators
- **Learning**: Users learn from past solutions and patterns

### Improved AI Analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI can identify recurring vs. unique issues
- **Solution Quality**: AI references proven solutions from similar cases
- **Trend Analysis**: AI can spot evolving problem patterns

## Code Implementation

### Primary Files
- **`src/nodes/summarizeFindings.ts`** - Main integration point
- **`src/nodes/memoryNodes.ts`** - Historical data retrieval
- **`src/storage/memoryService.ts`** - Case and pattern retrieval logic

### Key Functions
- **`memoryRetrievalNode()`** - Retrieves similar cases and patterns
- **`summarizeFindings()`** - Integrates historical context into AI prompt
- **`retrieveSimilarCases()`** - Finds relevant historical cases

### Integration Flow
1. **Memory Retrieval** → Finds similar cases and patterns
2. **Context Building** → Formats historical information
3. **AI Enhancement** → Includes context in diagnosis prompt
4. **User Delivery** → Historical insights in final response

## Historical Context Types

### 1. Similar Cases
```
Previous Case: "Offer pricing issue in production"
- Diagnosis: UPS pricing cache was stale
- Tools Used: getOfferPrice, analyzeUPSOfferPriceTool
- Outcome: Successful (reward: 2)
- Most Effective Tools: getOfferPrice, analyzeUPSOfferPriceTool
```

### 2. Diagnostic Patterns
```
Pattern for OFFER_PRICE in production:
- Common Tools: getOfferPrice, analyzeUPSOfferPriceTool, compareOffersTool
- Success Rate: 85%
- Usage Count: 12
```

### 3. Tool Effectiveness
```
Most Effective Tools: entityHistory, datadogErrors
(Based on 0.74 and 0.69 contribution scores from similar cases)
```

## Quality Improvements

### Pattern Recognition
- **Recurring Issues**: "This matches the pattern seen in 5 similar cases"
- **Unique Problems**: "This differs from typical package configuration issues"
- **Trend Analysis**: "Recent cases show increasing configuration problems"

### Solution Validation
- **Proven Solutions**: References solutions with high success rates
- **Tool Recommendations**: Suggests tools that worked in similar cases
- **Risk Assessment**: Warns about approaches that failed historically

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Context
- **Temporal Patterns**: "This issue has been increasing over the past month"
- **Environmental Trends**: "Similar issues more common in staging vs. production"
- **Team Learning**: "Solutions from your team vs. other teams"

### Interactive Context
- **Expandable Details**: Click to see full historical case details
- **Similarity Scoring**: Show how similar each historical case is
- **Success Prediction**: "Based on similar cases, 85% chance of resolution"

## Monitoring & Metrics
- User engagement with historical context sections
- Correlation between historical context presence and user satisfaction
- Accuracy of pattern recognition and trend identification
- Impact on diagnostic quality and user confidence
